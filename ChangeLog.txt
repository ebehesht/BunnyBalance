1. initiated the project
2. added touch interaction to the bunnies
3. bunnies have rigid body 2D, with colliders; the background has 4 box collider 2Ds that work as boundaries
4. prevent bunnies from "colliding" to each other (i.e., let them overlap each other):
	Solution 1:
	OnCollisionEnter2D function:
	Physics2D.IgnoreCollision(colliderToIgnore, this.GetComponent<Collider2D>());
	
	Solution 2:
	all the bunnies have the "foreground" sorted layer. Make a new layer for the object (top of the ispector, where it says Tag:, Layer:)
	Then go to Edit --> Project Settings --> Physics2D and then uncheck the selection for ForeGround, so that objects in this layer
	don't collide with each other. 
	
5. Now, fixed the touch events: added an event system, and a touchEvents script, to control when a touch is began, moved, and ended.

1. today, I am working on the physics of the seesaw.
first, add a rigid body to the seesaw; then adding 4 children for 4 collider boxes for the 4 seats on both sides
 
 
*** 02/04/2018
working on the physics of seesaw:
1. create a one-way collision between bunnies and the seesaw:
	seat object --> Box collider 2D --> used by effector
	add a platform effector 2D --> arc 180
	(this way, bunnies only collide with the seats from top)
	one problem with this is: I cannot use trigger, both don't work together
	
2. To disable forces on collision:
make the mass of bunnies very small relative to the mass of seesaw!!
Like 0.0001 for bunnies to 1000 for seesaw

3. now to detect if a bunny is on a seat, and then move the seesaw accordingly
first, define a public variable for class bunny: isBunnyOnSeat
then check it on touch end event

4. stick bunny to the seat:
wow, much more difficult than what I thought

use Hinge Joint 2D on bunnies, with seesaw as the connected rigid body
but disable it first, then enable it in the code.

Things to fix:
1. balance status
2. it matters where on bunny is touched, for example if dragging the bunny by its ears, it should not consider it as a weight.

Interesting: for some reason, decreasing the surface arc of the platform effector, makes the balance status working!
--> study this more later!


*** 02/08/2018
working on creating a customized texture data (texture2d)

*** 02/12/2018

1. Change the bunny to a better shape (ears too big!)

2. Add the second seats

3. Make the interaction between bunnies and the seesaw smoother:

first, moving the beam to balance position smoother --> not using the angle limits, but changing the "Maximum Motor Force"



Later: start on the training task


*** 04/29/2018

1. Add sound effect: when bunnies are put on the seats.

*** June 2018
List of changes to make:
1. work on the collision code
 --> detecting collision
 --> putting the bunnie on balance
2. don't let more than one bunny on a seat
3. work on the clonning: right now there are multiple bunnies, I can change it to remove clone bunnies when removed from the balance
4. work on the textures: create better textures with better differentiating between the five bunnies
5.

1. work on the collision:
the issue with changing the box collider to cover the below half is that it also affects the touch events.
Is there any way to create two collider boxes? one for touch events and one for sitting on the seesaw.

*** 06/23/2018 && 06/25/2018
1. work on collision:
I created 2 collision box: one capsule collider for touch events, and one bottom box collider for seating on the seesaw.
The collision between bunny and seat is much improved by making the box very narrow, since there was conflict between the two adjacent seats
2. don't let multiple bunnies on one seat: 
fixed, there was a bug in setting the occupied flag of the seat
3. added prompting sounds: balanced, made left heavier, made right heavier

issue: not playing two audio clips for seesaw: I had to add this code:
seesawSource.PlayOneShot(seesawMoveSound, 0.7F);
instead of: seesawSource.play();
4. updated the background image, position of seesaw, and position of bunnies
5. sit on a fixed position

Later: right now, the bunny cannot be moved from one seat to another; instead, it is removed. Fix this:
the issue is: the seat collision events are not fired after the bunny is put on the first seat.

Later: fix the issue with bunny on seesaw and when touch down or touch move, it removes the bunny even if it is just a tap or moving to another seat!


1. bunnies sitting on the seesaw
2. non-haptics version: bug with touch inputs, troubleshoot it
3. the replacing bunnies are strange!
