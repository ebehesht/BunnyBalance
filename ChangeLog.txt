1. initiated the project
2. added touch interaction to the bunnies
3. bunnies have rigid body 2D, with colliders; the background has 4 box collider 2Ds that work as boundaries
4. prevent bunnies from "colliding" to each other (i.e., let them overlap each other):
	Solution 1:
	OnCollisionEnter2D function:
	Physics2D.IgnoreCollision(colliderToIgnore, this.GetComponent<Collider2D>());
	
	Solution 2:
	all the bunnies have the "foreground" sorted layer. Make a new layer for the object (top of the ispector, where it says Tag:, Layer:)
	Then go to Edit --> Project Settings --> Physics2D and then uncheck the selection for ForeGround, so that objects in this layer
	don't collide with each other. 
	
5. Now, fixed the touch events: added an event system, and a touchEvents script, to control when a touch is began, moved, and ended.

1. today, I am working on the physics of the seesaw.
first, add a rigid body to the seesaw; then adding 4 children for 4 collider boxes for the 4 seats on both sides

working on the physics of seesaw:
1. create a one-way collision between bunnies and the seesaw:
	seat object --> Box collider 2D --> used by effector
	add a platform effector 2D --> arc 180
	(this way, bunnies only collide with the seats from top)
	one problem with this is: I cannot use trigger, both don't work together
	
2. To disable forces on collision:
make the mass of bunnies very small relative to the mass of seesaw!!
Like 0.0001 for bunnies to 1000 for seesaw

3. now to detect if a bunny is on a seat, and then move the seesaw accordingly
first, define a public variable for class bunny: isBunnyOnSeat
then check it on touch end event

4. stick bunny to the seat:
wow, much more difficult than what I thought

use Hinge Joint 2D on bunnies, with seesaw as the connected rigid body
but disable it first, then enable it in the code.

Things to fix:
1. balance status
2. it matters where on bunny is touched, for example if dragging the bunny by its ears, it should not consider it as a weight.

Interesting: for some reason, decreasing the surface arc of the platform effector, makes the balance status working!
--> study this more later!

working on creating a customized texture data (texture2d)

*** 02/12/2018

1. Change the bunny to a better shape (ears too big!)

2. Add the second seats

3. Make the interaction between bunnies and the seesaw smoother:

first, moving the beam to balance position smoother --> not using the angle limits, but changing the "Maximum Motor Force"



Later: start on the training task

1. Add sound effect: when bunnies are put on the seats.
